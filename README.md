## 📖 ICPC Memories

### ICPC Asia Regional – Vietnam Ho Chi Minh City 2025

In **2025**, we participated in the **ICPC Asia Regional Contest**, held in **Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam**.  
This was also the **final time** we took part in an ICPC contest as university students.

The contest marked the end of a long journey:
- Days of intensive training  
- Hours of intense and high-pressure competition  
- Silent moments of thinking side by side with teammates  

Although there was no award, **ICPC 2025** remains a memorable milestone, closing one chapter of our journey and opening new paths for the future.
